# SPACE-EXPRESS !

You have to bring some merchandise to your client as quick as possible ! But space is a messy and dangerous place, you might get trapped by space pirates or in an asteroids field ! Quick ! Where do we go next ?!

This game is a submission for the Open Jam 2019, it is completely open source, you can find the files on Github under the GPL 3.0 License.
